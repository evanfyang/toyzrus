# CS405G finalproject
University of Kentucky CS405G (Introduction to Databases) Final Project: Fall 2019 - Ecommerce


### Background
The objective of this application is to implement a client-side e-commerce application that communicates with a server-side database using PHP and MySQL. 

It is an online store for ToyzRUs that has 3 types of users:
- Customers
- Staff
- Managers

Customers can register/login to access the site, then view and query items by category and keyword. They can add items to their shopping cart, place orders, check order status, cancel orders (within 24 hours), and keep track of their order history.

Staff can login with a pre-existing ID and password in order to view inventory, add/re-stock items, and view/ship customer orders. 

Managers can also login with a pre-existing ID and password as well as perform all staff functions. In addition, they can view sale statistics and implement sales promotions.
